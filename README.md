Competitive Game of Life (the acronym is pronounced "seagull")

How it works:
  - The game board is a simulation of Conway's Game of Life.
  - The game starts with a number of cells pre-filled
  - Your objective is to place your cells such that after a number of simulation steps the number of filled cells is less than some threshold.

Completed so far:
  - Some game logic to handle game state transitions.

To-do (roughly in order from top to bottom):
  - Finish the update board logic
  - Add rendering logic
  - Enable player interaction
  - Create save states (so players can make boards and play on them)
  - Add game modes (unsure exactly what this means yet; distant to-do goal)
