Competitive Game of Life (the acronym is pronounced "seagull")

How it works:
 - The game board is a simulation of Conway's Game of Life.
 - The game starts with a number of cells pre-filled
 - Your objective is to place your cells such that after a number of simulation steps the number of filled cells is less than some threshold.

Completed so far:
  Nothing of note yet. This project is just beginning.
