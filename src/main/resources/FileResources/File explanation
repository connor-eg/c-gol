A file for this game is created by placing several numbers in the correct order in the file, separated by line breaks
The order for the numbers describing the game is this:

 - Rows
 - Columns
 - Maximum number of generations
 - Target number of cells

After that, it is followed by a rectangle of numbers describing the game board.
A 0 describes an unfilled cell, a 1 describes a filled cell, and a 2 describes a no-go cell.
Cells in a given row are placed on the same line, with a line break between rows. Example:

0010000
0001000     <- This describes a 7x5 grid that contains a glider and zero no-go cells.
0111000
0000000
0000000

The full file for the above grid might look like this
7
5
30
3
0010000
0001000
0111000
0000000
0000000

In English: "A 7x5 grid, where the user tries to get the number of filled cells to 3 in at most 30 generations."
Space below the last line of the board is not read by the program and may be used for comments.
